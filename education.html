<br><br>

This school has been built on the site of Lot 4502 with an area of ​​one quarter of an acre which was bought by the villagers for a price of RM1,000.00. Its construction is done in a cooperative manner. At the beginning the building was erected measuring 60 × 20 feet, with a thatched roof and the structure of the building was made of forest wood cut down by himself. Seri Pematang Rengas National School is located near the banks of Sungai Simpang Kiri in Kampung Parit Karjan about 6 km from Pekan Seri Medan or about 27 km from

<br><br>

The opening of this school was officiated by His Highness <b> Tuan Syed Esa bin Alwee </b> who at the time held the position of Inspector of Malay Schools in the Batu Pahat District and was named SERI PEMATANG RENGAS NATIONAL SCHOOL. The name Seri Pematang Rengas is taken in conjunction with the names of five rengas trees that grow on the banks of the river near the school building.

<br><br>

The name remains in use to this day. When it was first established, the school had a total of <b> 60 students </b> with a head teacher and an assistant teacher.

<br><br>

In 1961 this school received a government grant of <b> RM5,000 00.</b> With that amount of money, the length of the school was increased to 140 feet and the roof was replaced with shingle.

<br><br>

In 1968 the administration of this school was completely taken over by the government. In 1971 the villagers petitioned the government for the school site to be moved to a site that had been chosen because the original site was often flooded during the <b> monsoon season.</b>

<br><br>

After getting approval from the government <b> YB En. Mohamed bin Rahmat </b>, then the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Education, accompanied by the Parliamentary Representative

, made a survey visit to the proposed site which was set to be located in the hillside area of ​​lot 8114 with an area of ​​6 acres that had been purchased by the government.

In 1977 a two-storey building and a canteen were built on a hill to replace the old school building. The distance between the new building site and the old building site is only about 1.3 km. With that, the problems faced by village children during schooling in the monsoon season ended.

<br><br>

After that, some additional buildings were built to add more comfort and needs for the children studying in this school. In 1995 a room for Life Skills Lessons with an area of ​​24 × 30 feet was donated by Parit Sulong Parliamentary Representative <b> YB Mrs. Noraini binti Ahmad .</b>

<br><br>

In 1999, this school received an additional building from the government that accommodated two classrooms to accommodate the lack of classrooms it was facing. Apart from that in 2001 the PIBG has successfully built a building which is used as a Fardu ain Training Room. Now at the beginning of 2002, another infrastructure is under construction which is a computer laboratory and has now functioned as ICT learning.

<font size="5px"> <b> Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Medan </b> </a> </font>

<font size="4px">
 or SMK Seri Medan for short, is a well established secondary school located in <b> Seri Medan, Batu Pahat, Johor </b>

<br><br>

Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Medan was established on <b> January 1, 1965.</b> At the beginning the students of this school boarded in the building of Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Medan in 1965 with a total of 72 students and a teaching staff of 4. Due to the increasing number of students, some of the students had to board at Chong Hwa Chinese National Primary School, Seri Medan on January 1, 1970. At that time, the number of students had increased to 342 people and the teachers were 14 people.

<br><br>

Considering the increasing number of students and the need for a school of its own and creating its own identity, the construction of this school building on the current site was started in 1971. This building was completed at the end of 1972. new building and this block has 8 classrooms, 2 SRT rooms, 2 Guidance Science rooms, 1 office room, 1 storage room, male and female student toilets and male and female teacher toilets. A medium-sized canteen was also established. On January 16, 1973, the students and teachers who boarded at Seri Medan National School and Chung Hwa Chinese National Primary School migrated to the new building with new enthusiasm and determination. In the same year, this school received attention from the Ministry of Education because thanks to the hard work of students, PIBG teachers and the local community, the Malaysian Minister of Education, <b> YB Tuan Haji Mohamed bin Yaacob </b> was willing to inaugurate this school on 8 September 1973 in a glorious event.

<br><br>

Before this school was established, many students who wanted to continue their secondary education from the Seri Medan area had to go to Bandar Batu Pahat which is about 20 kilometers away. Since many students live in remote areas in Seri Medan and face transportation problems, dropouts are inevitable. With the formation of this secondary school it is a blessing for the residents of this area. Pupils from Seri Medan National School, Seri Sejati National School, Seri Pematang Rengas National School, Tenaga Setia National School, Seri Pasir National School, Seri Dayong National School, Sejagong National School and Chong Hwa Chinese National Primary School have the opportunity to continue their education their secondary. With this the dropout problem has been reduced.

<br><br>

Given the rapid increase in the number of students and teachers, the existing building cannot accommodate such a large number. Therefore in 1981 an additional building was erected. The two-story building contains 8 classrooms, a library and a Science Guide laboratory. An Industrial Arts building block was also erected.

<br><br>

After 1981, the number of students in this school increased. In 1982, the number of students was 1288 and in 1983, the number increased to 1301. To accommodate such a large number of students, in 1985 another one-story additional building containing 6 classrooms was built in a prefabricated project.

<br><br>

Now with the implementation of KBSM and to ensure that Life Skills subjects can be conducted in an orderly and perfect manner, another one-story building containing 4 classrooms was built and completed in 1989. This additional building is a cooperative project.

<br><br>

At the end of 1991 a three-story building was completed. This building contains 3 Pure Science laboratories, 12 classrooms, 4 small rooms and a teacher's toilet. With the construction of this building, the classroom needs for the students of this school will be complete. From the beginning of the 1992 session, the lesson time at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Medan was only in the morning session.
